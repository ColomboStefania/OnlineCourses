## How to start

- clone repo
- yarn install 
- yarn start

## Improvements

- the app is not responsive yet
- I was a bit limited by the short deadline (3hours) and I could not create a similar layout as Career Foundry's website
- I would have spent more time on adding comments for other developers, so that they can understand the coding steps
- I stick to the design material I knew (Material UI) and some part of the code was already given and I believe that comments where needed here. however here is the documentation (https://material-ui.com/demos/tables/)
- A further check whether double or single quotes are consistent was needed

## What I will do in the future

- I want to first grasb the best practices of the development team (that I am working with) in term of code structure and cleaness, and I want to learn from them what is the best way to deliver clean code (every company might have different standard) and I want to increasingly  adapt to the norms agreed. 
- I am really eager to learn what is the best way to make a scalable code
